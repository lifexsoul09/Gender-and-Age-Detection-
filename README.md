# Gender and Age Detection

This project aims to detect the gender and age of individuals in real-time using a pre-trained deep learning model. The system processes input images or video frames to estimate a person's gender (male or female) and approximate age.

## Features

- Detects gender (Male/Female).
- Estimates age within a specified range.
- Real-time processing using a webcam or video feed.
- Supports image file input for static image predictions.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes **OpenCV**, **TensorFlow**, and **Keras** to process images and make predictions using a pre-trained deep learning model. The model is trained on a dataset of human faces and can predict the gender and age range of individuals.

## Dependencies

To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Numpy

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:
